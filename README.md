# Bank_Note_Authentication
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

# Business Problem
Here we have build a model, that on the given information of note's we predict the the given note is authenticated or note.

# Our Goal
We have build web app for the same using Flask and Flasgger for the ease of using the project.
We have also used Docker for Dockerizing the project so that we can containerize the project and run it on another required machine.

# Tools Used
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Random Forest Classifier
7. Pickle
8. Flask
9. Flasgger
10. Swagger
11. Docker
